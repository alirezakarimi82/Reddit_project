a2obkm,"Science Discussion: Last week a team of scientists in China announced that they used the genome editing technology CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the DNA of human embryos, resulting in the birth of twin girls. Let’s discuss the technology and ethics of this development!","Hi [reddit](https://i.imgur.com/sqOjWz6.png)! Last week, [researchers announced at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing that they had altered the genomes of twin girls](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/claim-of-crispred-baby-girls-stuns-genome-editing-summit/) using [CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YKFw2KZA5o) approaches.  This marks the first time that we know of that this technology has been used to modify humans.

He Jiankui had previously presented work on genome editing in human, monkey, and mouse embryos at a scientific meeting in 2017, but he had made no indication at the time that he intended to use the altered embryos to initiate a pregnancy.

Based on the announcement last week, He Jiankui’s university, Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, issued a statement indicating that it had been unaware of the research and that this work had “seriously violated academic ethics and codes of conduct.” In addition, [Rice University has launched an ethics investigation](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/rice-university-opens-investigation-into-researcher-who-worked-on-crisprd-baby-project/) into a collaborator of He Jiankui, Michael Deem, who is a professor there.

The research has not yet been published in a peer reviewed paper, so some details of the research remain unknown to the public, but it’s important to note that gene editing is also being pursued in the US to help correct severe genetic diseases- a company Editas recently received FDA approval for an application to start enrolling patients into a clinical trial for a CRISPR-based treatment for LCA10, a rare form of blindness.

To help answer your questions about this news we have guests from George Church’s lab at Harvard who are experts in gene editing technology, and a prominent ethicist from Vanderbilt University.

Ellen Clayton, MD, JD (u/Ellen_Clayton): I am a general pediatrician and law professor who focuses on ethical, legal, and social issues raised by genetics.  I was a member of the NASEM committee on gene editing.

Eriona Hysolli, PhD (u/Eriona Hysolli): I am a postdoc in the Church lab exploring multiplex gene editing for mammoth de-extinction.

Cory Smith, PhD (u/Cory_Smith_PhD): I'm a postdoctoral research fellow working in the Church lab on synthetic biology technology development for Genome Project write. One of my research aims is to improve the delivery, efficiency, and safety of current DNA editors including CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, AAV, and Base Editors to overcome the current limitations preventing multiplex engineering at genome-wide scale in mammalian cells.",sci

It will use cutting edge instruments, to delve deep beneath the  surface and seek the fingerprints of the processes that formed the  terrestrial planets. It does so by measuring the planet's ""vital signs"":  its ""pulse"" (seismology), ""temperature"" (heat flow), and ""reflexes""  (precision tracking).[^(1)](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/overview/)

Mission controllers at NASA-JPL have received a signal from NASA's InSight lander on the Mars surface via MarCO and a beep from InSight's X-band radio. In the coming hours, engineers will be checking on the spacecraft's health. 

A post-landing news briefing expected at 2 p.m. PST (5 p.m. EST).

Meanwhile, you can check out the [InSight website](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/), see the [landing status](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/landing/status/), or [a short video explanation of the entire mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKLITDmm4NA).

9myt6l,"Science Discussion: We are researchers at Caltech working with Professor Frances Arnold, one of the recipients of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. We use directed evolution to engineer proteins to do chemistry not found in nature (yet). Let's Discuss!!","Hi Reddit,


We are graduate students and postdocs in Professor Frances Arnold’s research group at
Caltech. We use directed evolution, the algorithm for which Frances won the Nobel Prize last
week, as a tool to engineer proteins.


Directed evolution, like Darwinian evolution, is about “survival of the fittest” by selecting
beneficial mutations that enhance a desired function. The key difference is that in directed
evolution the person running the experiment chooses which mutations are beneficial – in other
words, we choose the definition of “fittest” in “survival of the fittest”.


Understanding how a protein’s sequence connects to its structure is challenging ([relevant
XKCD]( https://xkcd.com/1430/)), and understanding how that structure confers function is
another significant challenge. A strength of directed evolution is that one does not need to know
a lot about the protein to use it; all one needs is the genetic information (the DNA that encodes
the protein of interest) and a way of testing each variant for the function of interest. We don’t
need to know exactly how or why the protein is able to catalyze a reaction or understand why a
mutation enhances that activity.


Proteins have been engineered using directed evolution for myriad uses, from higher stability for
use in your laundry detergent to remove stains to producing blockbuster pharmaceutical
compounds in place of less environmentally friendly syntheses.


Unfortunately Frances is not able to join us for the discussion, but we are happy to answer any
questions you have about directed evolution, proteins, Caltech, and beyond!

**Your hosts today are:**

Anders Knight ( /u/AndersKnight ): Anders is a fourth-year bioengineering graduate student in
the Arnold lab. He works on engineering heme proteins to do carbene transfer reactions not
found in nature. [An open-access example of a paper on such reactions is available here.](
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00548)


Kari Hernandez ( /u/Kari_Hernandez ): Kari is in the 4th year of her Ph.D. and received her B.S.
in chemical engineering from the University of Arizona. Her work focuses on making useful
molecules by evolving heme proteins to do non-natural reactions.


Jennifer Kan ( /u/JennyKan ): Jenny is a postdoc in Frances Arnold’s lab at Caltech. Her
favourite thing to do is to teach proteins to make cool bonds. Twitter: @sbjennykan


Tina Boville ( /u/TinaBoville ): Tina is a postdoc in the Arnold lab evolving enzymes to make
chemical building blocks called noncanonical amino acids. She is very interested in green
chemistry and lab sustainability and is a fellow at the Resnick Institute.


Patrick Almhjell ( /u/PatrickAlmhjell ): Patrick is a second-year graduate student in the
Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics program at Caltech, working on the same project as
/u/TinaBoville. Patrick loves chemistry but not the chemistry lab, so he appreciates being able to
use enzymes in water instead. [An open-access review on noncanonical amino acid synthesis is
available here.](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/cs/c8cs00665b)


Kevin Yang ( /u/KevinKYang ): Kevin is a 5th year PhD student in Frances Arnold's lab. His
research focuses on using machine learning to accelerate directed evolution. [Read his open-
access paper for an example of using machine learning in protein
engineering.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005786)",sci

&gt;The power of evolution is revealed through the diversity of life. The 2018 Nobel Laureates in Chemistry have taken control of evolution and used it for purposes that bring the greatest benefit to humankind. Enzymes produced through directed evolution are used to manufacture everything from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. Antibodies evolved using a method called phage display can combat autoimmune diseases and in some cases cure metastatic cancer.  
Since the first seeds of life arose around 3.7 billion years ago, almost every crevice on Earth has filled with different organisms. Life has spread to hot springs, deep oceans and dry deserts, all because evolution has solved a number of chemical problems. Life’s chemical tools – proteins – have been optimised, changed and renewed, creating incredible diversity.  
This year’s Nobel Laureates in Chemistry have been inspired by the power of evolution and used the same principles – genetic change and selection – to develop proteins that solve mankind’s chemical problems.  
One half of this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded to Frances H. Arnold. In 1993, she conducted the first directed evolution of enzymes, which are proteins that catalyse chemical reactions. Since then, she has refined the methods that are now routinely used to develop new catalysts. The uses of Frances Arnold’s enzymes include more environmentally friendly manufacturing of chemical substances, such as pharmaceuticals, and the production of renewable fuels for a greener transport sector.  
The other half of this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry is shared by George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter. In 1985, George Smith developed an elegant method known as phage display, where a bacteriophage – a virus that infects bacteria – can be used to evolve new proteins. Gregory Winter used phage display for the directed evolution of antibodies, with the aim of producing new pharmaceuticals. The first one based on this method, adalimumab, was approved in 2002 and is used for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Since then, phage display has produced anti-bodies that can neutralise toxins, counteract autoimmune diseases and cure metastatic cancer.

One half of the award went to Arthur Ashkin for **optical tweezers and their application to biological systems** and the other half jointly to Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland for **their method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses.**

The official press release can be viewed [here](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2018/summary/), and a link to the scientific explanation of the award from the Nobel committee can be viewed [here](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/advanced-physicsprize2018.pdf).

&gt;The inventions being honoured this year have revolutionised laser physics. Extremely small objects and incredibly rapid processes are now being seen in a new light. Advanced precision instruments are opening up unexplored areas of research and a multitude of industrial and medical applications.  
&gt;  
&gt;Arthur Ashkin invented optical tweezers that grab particles, atoms, viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers. This new tool allowed Ashkin to realise an old dream of science fiction – using the radiation pressure of light to move physical objects. He succeeded in getting laser light to push small particles towards the centre of the beam and to hold them there. Optical tweezers had been invented.  
&gt;  
&gt;A major breakthrough came in 1987, when Ashkin used the tweezers to capture living bacteria without harming them. He immediately began studying biological systems and optical tweezers are now widely used to investigate the machinery of life.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland paved the way towards the shortest and most intense laser pulses ever created by mankind. Their revolutionary article was published in 1985 and was the foundation of Strickland’s doctoral thesis.  
&gt;  
&gt;Using an ingenious approach, they succeeded in creating ultrashort high-intensity laser pulses without destroying the amplifying material. First they stretched the laser pulses in time to reduce their peak power, then amplified them, and finally compressed them. If a pulse is compressed in time and becomes shorter, then more light is packed together in the same tiny space – the intensity of the pulse increases dramatically.  
&gt;  
&gt;Strickland and Mourou's newly invented technique, called chirped pulse amplification, CPA, soon became standard for subsequent high-intensity lasers. Its uses include the millions of corrective eye surgeries that are conducted every year using the sharpest of laser beams.  
&gt;  
&gt;The innumerable areas of application have not yet been completely explored. However, even now these celebrated inventions allow us to rummage around in the microworld in the best spirit of Alfred Nobel – for the greatest benefit to humankind.",sci

&amp;#x200B;

The official press release can be viewed [here](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/press-release/). 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Cancer kills millions of people every year and is one of humanity’s greatest health challenges. By stimulating the  inherent ability of our immune system to attack tumor cells this year’s Nobel Laureates have established an entirely new principle for cancer  therapy.   
&gt;  
&gt;James P. Allison studied a known protein that  functions as a brake on the immune system. He realized the potential of  releasing the brake and thereby unleashing our immune cells to attack  tumors. He then developed this concept into a brand new approach for  treating patients.  
&gt;  
&gt;In parallel, Tasuku Honjo discovered a protein on  immune cells and, after careful exploration of its function, eventually  revealed that it also operates as a brake, but with a different  mechanism of action. Therapies based on his discovery proved to be  strikingly effective in the fight against cancer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Allison and Honjo showed how different strategies  for inhibiting the brakes on the immune system can be used in the  treatment of cancer. The seminal discoveries by the two Laureates  constitute a landmark in our fight against cancer.",sci
