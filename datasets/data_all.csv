them with research institutions that will pay to use their genomic data for biomedical research by signing up for the nebula platform users can share their health and genomic information with the research community to help contribute to medical breakthroughs and receive compensation such as free genomic sequencing for doing so nebula s platform uses encryption based privacy enhancing technologies to give individuals the ability to transparently control who has access to their data and to ensure that their data remains private even while it is being shared users who contribute data to the nebula platform will be able to know who is requesting access to their data and for what purpose and can agree to or decline that request as of this week consumers can sign up on the nebula
